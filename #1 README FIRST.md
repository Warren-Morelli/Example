## Title - Used Car Valuation Prediction (A Linear Regression Model for Estimating Sale Prices)

**Authors**: Warren Morelli


## Overview
A used car enterprise seeks a precise approach for predicting used car prices to facilitate their acquisition of undervalued vehicles and to accurately set prices, thus enabling profitability upon sale. My Goal: Predict the sale price of a used car based on its various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition.



## Data

The data utilized in this project was sourced from the Used-Car-data CSV file in Kaggle. The data set is comprised of 7906 rows and 18 columns, providing an ample amount of information for linear regression modeling purposes. This comprehensive data set is well-suited to support the modeling process and can be expected to yield reliable results.


## Method & Results

To develop an accurate linear regression model for predicting used car prices, I followed these steps:

1. Data cleaning

2. Addressing multicollinearity

3. Creation of dummy variables

4. Splitting data into training and testing sets and performing cross-validation

5. Reviewing OLS results

6. Conducting log transformation to improve skewness

7. Removing predictors with low p-values

8. Developing and testing the predictive model.
